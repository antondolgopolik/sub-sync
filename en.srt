1
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:39,310
Are you paying attention?

2
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:43,843
Good.

3
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:49,786
If you're not listening carefully,
you will miss things,

4
00:01:49,886 --> 00:01:52,289
important things.

5
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:58,436
I will not pause. I will not repeat myself,
and you will not interrupt me.

6
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:04,768
You think that because you are sitting
where you are and I am sitting where I am

7
00:02:04,868 --> 00:02:07,838
that you are in control
of what is about to happen.

8
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:12,543
You're mistaken. I am in control.

9
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:17,983
Because I know things
that you do not know.

10
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:23,921
Manchester Police Department,
please hold.

11
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:29,359
Windows broken. Home's been ransacked.

12
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,194
Send a detective down, will you?

13
00:02:32,094 --> 00:02:36,033
What I will need from you now
is a commitment.

14
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:41,505
You will listen closely, and you
will not judge me until I am finished.

15
00:02:41,605 --> 00:02:45,042
If you cannot commit to this,
then please leave the room.

16
00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:46,776
Come in.

17
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:50,772
But if you choose to stay,
remember you chose to be here.

18
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:55,473
What happens from this moment forwards
is not my responsibility.

19
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:56,387
It's yours.

20
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:02,058
Pay attention.

21
00:03:14,804 --> 00:03:19,810
- What's all this, then?
- Turing, Alan. Professor at King's.

22
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,846
- Seems there's been a burglary.
- Oh? What of?

23
00:03:22,946 --> 00:03:24,748
Well, that's just it.
Nothing missing, really.

24
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:28,552
What's he doing in Manchester?

25
00:03:28,652 --> 00:03:31,556
Something with machines.

26
00:03:38,362 --> 00:03:40,497
The project at the NPL.

27
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:43,434
I checked,
but he won't say what it's on.

28
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:49,306
Professor Turing?
Detective Nock, Manchester Police.

29
00:03:53,948 --> 00:03:57,152
Sergeant Staehl here tells me
you had a burglary last night.

30
00:03:57,522 --> 00:03:58,682
Professor Turing?

31
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:02,719
Take a step back,
and don't breath heavily.

32
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,288
- Breathe?
- Undiluted cyanide.

33
00:04:05,388 --> 00:04:09,426
It wouldn't take more
than a thimbleful to kill you.

34
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:14,865
- Disappointing.
- Pardon?

35
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:18,001
I had hoped for a bit more.

36
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:21,471
Sergeant Staehl, is it just me, or do you
get the sense that we're being insulted?

37
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:23,557
Last night, you had a break-in.

38
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:26,342
Your neighbor, Mr. Springborn,
called to report the noise.

39
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:29,646
He said there was quite a ruckus.
Only you say nothing was taken.

40
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:32,228
It's odd. So, how about you
tell us what happened,

41
00:04:32,328 --> 00:04:34,194
and we'll find the chap who did this.

42
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:38,388
Gentlemen, I don't believe that
you could find the chap that did this

43
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:41,524
if he walked up to you
and spat in your face.

44
00:04:41,624 --> 00:04:45,896
What I could us right now is not
a bobby, but a really good cleaning lady.

45
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:48,757
So, unless one of you
has an apron in your car,

46
00:04:48,857 --> 00:04:52,239
I suggest you file your reports
and leave me alone.

47
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,374
As you say, Professor Turing.

48
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:02,546
Best of luck with your cyanide.

49
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:06,016
I'll give you a quid if you can
name me a more insufferable sod.

50
00:05:06,116 --> 00:05:09,619
- Seemed a bit forced, though, didn't it?
- Don't know what you mean.

51
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:12,462
Well, if you didn't want a pair of bobbies
digging around in your personal affairs,

52
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,792
that'd have been a stellar way
to make sure they don't.

53
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:19,563
- Tell me you don't think this is suspicious.
- I don't think this is suspicious.

54
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:23,605
A mysterious professor who won't admit
he's had something stolen from his house?

55
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:28,516
I think Alan Turing's hiding something.

56
00:05:38,382 --> 00:05:41,918
War declared!
800,000 children evacuated!

57
00:05:42,018 --> 00:05:44,822
German bombs on their way!
Get your papers here!

58
00:05:44,922 --> 00:05:47,390
Fresh off the press! War declared!

59
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,695
800,000 children evacuated!
German bombs expected soon!

60
00:06:17,487 --> 00:06:21,092
This morning,
the British Ambassador in Berlin

61
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:23,493
handed the German government

62
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:28,232
a final note stating
that unless we heard from them,

63
00:06:28,332 --> 00:06:33,337
by 11:00, a state of war
would exist between us.

64
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:39,176
I have to tell you now that no such
undertaking has been received.

65
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:44,247
And that, consequently,
this country is at war

66
00:06:44,347 --> 00:06:46,250
with Germany.

67
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:16,513
For the second time
in the lives of most of us,

68
00:07:16,613 --> 00:07:18,615
we are...

69
00:07:18,715 --> 00:07:20,517
at war.

70
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:22,920
To find

71
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,189
a peaceful way out...

72
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:30,728
Papers, please.

73
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:08,465
What are you doing here?

74
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:12,769
- Oh, the lady told me to wait.
- In my office?

75
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:16,752
She tell you to help yourself
to tea while you were here?

76
00:08:16,852 --> 00:08:18,775
No, she didn't.

77
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,712
She obviously didn't tell you
what a joke was, then, either, I gather.

78
00:08:22,312 --> 00:08:23,849
Was she supposed to?

79
00:08:25,682 --> 00:08:29,052
- Who are you?
- Alan Turing.

80
00:08:30,304 --> 00:08:32,752
Turing. The mathematician.

81
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:35,191
- Correct.
- However could I have guessed?

82
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,462
Well, you didn't. You just
read it on that piece of paper.

83
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:41,131
King's College, Cambridge.

84
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:44,334
Now, it says here you were a bit of
a prodigy in the maths department.

85
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:47,337
I'm not sure I can
evaluate that, Mr....

86
00:08:47,437 --> 00:08:49,806
- How old are you, Mr. Turing?
- 27.

87
00:08:49,906 --> 00:08:52,242
And how old were you when you became
a Fellow at Cambridge?

88
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:54,144
- 24.
- And how old were you...

89
00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:57,547
when you published this paper
that has a title I can barely understand?

90
00:08:57,647 --> 00:08:59,261
23.

91
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:02,285
And you don't think that qualifies you
as a certified prodigy?

92
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:05,455
Well, Newton discovered
binomial theorem aged 22.

93
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:09,225
Einstein wrote four papers that changed
the world by the age of 26.

94
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:13,196
As far as I can tell, I've...
I've barely made par.

95
00:09:13,296 --> 00:09:16,199
- My God, you're serious.
- Would you prefer I made a joke?

96
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:18,335
Oh, I don't think you know
what those are.

97
00:09:18,435 --> 00:09:21,471
Hardly seems fair that that's a
requirement for employment here, Mr...

98
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:25,075
Commander Denniston, Royal Navy.
All right, Mr. Turing, I'll bite.

99
00:09:25,175 --> 00:09:27,877
Why do you wish to work
for His Majesty's government?

100
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:29,346
Oh, I don't, really.

101
00:09:30,732 --> 00:09:32,449
Are you a bleeding pacifist?

102
00:09:32,749 --> 00:09:35,618
I'm... agnostic about violence.

103
00:09:35,718 --> 00:09:38,121
Well, you do realize
that 600 miles away from London

104
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:42,525
there's this nasty little chap called Hitler
who wants to engulf Europe in tyranny?

105
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,929
- Politics isn't really my area of expertise.
- Really?

106
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,833
Well, I believe you've just set the record
for the shortest job interview

107
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:52,336
in British military history.

108
00:09:52,936 --> 00:09:54,628
Mother says I can be
off-putting sometimes

109
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:57,273
on account of being one of the best
mathematicians in the world.

110
00:09:57,373 --> 00:10:00,243
- In the world?
- Oh, yes.

111
00:10:00,843 --> 00:10:03,679
Do you know how many people
I've rejected for this program?

112
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:04,546
No.

113
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,883
Well, that's right,
because we're a top-secret program.

114
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:09,019
But I'll tell you,
just because we're friends,

115
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:13,657
that only last week, I rejected one
of our great nation's top linguists.

116
00:10:13,757 --> 00:10:15,959
Knows German better than Bertolt Brecht.
